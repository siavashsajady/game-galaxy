# Video Game Discovery App

This is a mini version of the [RAWG](https://www.rawg.io) website, a video game discovery app built with React and TypeScript. The app allows users to search for games, filter games by genre and platforms, and sort games according to their preferences. It features a toggle between dark and light mode and utilizes Chakra UI for building the user interface. The project was developed without an upfront design, with improvements being made iteratively as the implementation progressed.
